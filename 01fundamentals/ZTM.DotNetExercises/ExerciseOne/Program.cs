// Challenge 1:
// Define a loop that defines a variable with the value 0 and stops at 20. Increase the value of the variable at every iteration.
// Decide what loop fits this problem best. Print a message to the console, including the variable's value for every iteration.

for (int i = 0; i < 21; i++)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"Current value: {i}");
}
